## Using Issues

Issues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. Issue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance.

## Using Branches

Branches are an important part of the GitHub flow because they allow us to separate our work from the `master` branch. Everyone's work is safe while you contribute. A single project can have several branches, each suggesting a new change to the `master` branch. We keep branches organized by keeping them concise and short-lived. A single branch should represent a single new feature or bug fix. This reduces confusion among contributors.

## Commits 101

When you’re finished creating or making changes to a file on, scroll to the bottom of the page. Then find the "Commit new file" section.

In the first field, type a commit message. The commit message should briefly tell contributors about the changes you are introducing to the file.

### Rules to live by for commit messages:

- Don’t end your commit message with a period.
- Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.
- Use active voice. For example, "add" instead of "added" and "create" instead of "created".
- Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.

## Using Pull requests

Once you’ve created a commit, it’s time to share your proposed change through a pull request! Issues encourage discussion with other contributors and collaborators. Pull requests help you share your changes, receive feedback on them, and iterate on them until they’re perfect! Check out this video to learn more:

The pull request keeps the changes you just made on your branch and proposes applying them to the `master` branch.
