## Using Issues

Issues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. Issue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance.

## Using Branches

Branches are an important part of the GitHub flow because they allow us to separate our work from the `master` branch. Everyone's work is safe while you contribute. A single project can have several branches, each suggesting a new change to the `master` branch. We keep branches organized by keeping them concise and short-lived. A single branch should represent a single new feature or bug fix. This reduces confusion among contributors.
