## Using Issues

Issues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. Issue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance.

## Using Branches

Branches are an important part of the GitHub flow because they allow us to separate our work from the `master` branch. Everyone's work is safe while you contribute. A single project can have several branches, each suggesting a new change to the `master` branch. We keep branches organized by keeping them concise and short-lived. A single branch should represent a single new feature or bug fix. This reduces confusion among contributors.

## Commits 101

When you’re finished creating or making changes to a file on, scroll to the bottom of the page. Then find the "Commit new file" section.

In the first field, type a commit message. The commit message should briefly tell contributors about the changes you are introducing to the file.

### Rules to live by for commit messages:

- Don’t end your commit message with a period.
- Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.
- Use active voice. For example, "add" instead of "added" and "create" instead of "created".
- Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.
