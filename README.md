Linden is a high-opportunity Columbus neighborhood in need of
economic improvement. Linden was chosen as the first neighborhood district for its numerous
socio-economic challenges, including low household income, lack of major employers and
high infant mortality rates. These problems are compounded by the lack of access to
transportation options. Despite proximity to the central core of the city, basic services such as
healthcare, grocery stores and banking are scarce within its boundaries. Many residents are
transit-reliant, yet planning and completing a trip to access employment and services can be
challenging, particularly for parents with young children, seniors and travelers with
disabilities. There are also many first-mile/last-mile (FMLM) challenges in the district.
